Revision 2021!

My name is George but you can call me M3noetius. I am fascinated about computer hacking and I really like to learn about what is happening inside every process. Currently I am stuck at learning about AV-Bypassing. 

Why Av-Bypassing ? The cybernetics pro-lab demands it ! I started the lab and it required AV-Bypassing I can bypass it but the process and the internals of how this works is just super interesting. You deep dive to windows system internals and what happens inside this software is sooo cool !
